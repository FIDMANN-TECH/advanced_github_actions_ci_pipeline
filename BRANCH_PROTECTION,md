# Branch Protection & Merge Policy

## Main Branch Protection
The `main` branch should be protected with the following rules:
- Require pull request before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
  - CI workflow
  - CodeQL workflow
- Require branches to be up to date before merging

## Purpose
These protections ensure:
- No unreviewed code reaches production
- All quality gates are enforced
- CI and security checks are mandatory

This mirrors industry-standard DevOps governance practices.
